    server admin happens to have configured.

    Workflow:
      * Initial deploy / Add client (via UI button) → SSH to the server,
        run `setup-wireguard-server.sh add-client <name>`, parse the URI
        it returns, INSERT a row here with status='available'.

        exported from the same client (rare but allowed — e.g. when
